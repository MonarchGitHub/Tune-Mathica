# üìí Wiki

This project repository has [a great wiki](https://github.com/chroline/Tune-Mathica/wiki) (currently WIP) that you should consider reading! It goes into detail about the project from a more technical aspect. If you are interested in learning more about the app itself, go ahead and check it out!

# üë®‚Äçüíª Tech stack

Here's a brief high-level overview of the tech stack the Well app uses:

<!-- - This project uses the [Flutter app development framework](https://flutter.dev/). Flutter is a cross-platform hybrid app development platform which allows us to use a single codebase for apps on mobile, desktop, and the web.
- For persistent storage (database), the app uses the [Hive](https://hivedb.dev/) package which allows the app to create a custom storage schema and save it to a local database.
- To send local push notifications, the app uses the [flutter_local_notifications](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_local_notifications) package which supports Android, iOS, and macOS.
  - üö® Currently, notifications aren't working on macOS. This is a known issue that we are working to resolve!
- The app uses the font ["Work Sans"](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Work+Sans) as its main font, and the design of the app adheres to the material design guidelines.

For more information on the technologies that power the Well app, check out the [Tech Stack](https://github.com/chroline/well_app/wiki/Tech-Stack) page on our wiki. -->
